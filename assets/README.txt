Place a Windows icon file named `icon.png` (or `icon.ico`) in this folder to be used by the installer.

You can create an icon from a PNG using many online tools or image editors. Recommended sizes: 256x256, 128x128, 64x64.

This placeholder prevents build errors during development. Replace with your real icon before packaging.
